# IP-Forwarding
A C program implemented in routers to forward IP packets to the next hop

See README.txt for pseudocode.

This program is to be implemented in routers in order to forward IP packets to the next hop. I wrote this program as part of a project for my Networking course at the University of Kentucky. 

The program is fully tested and functional -- I received a 97 on the project.
